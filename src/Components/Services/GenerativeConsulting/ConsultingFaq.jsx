                                    Generative AI operates through a two-step process: training and generation. During training, it learns patterns and relationships from a dataset. This could be text, images, or any structured data. These patterns are captured in the form of mathematical parameters within the model. After training, the generative AI can produce new, similar data by sampling from these learned parameters. For instance, it can generate realistic text, images, music, or other content based on the patterns it has internalized. This ability to create novel, contextually relevant data makes generative AI a powerful tool with applications across various domains, from art and content creation to data augmentation and more.
